# Wine_Customer_Analysis
COGS118B Final Project
Hi, this is our final project submission. The central aim of our project is to cluster the customers based on some features selected and figure out their willingness to purchase wine. After we divide the customers according to their willingness, we can send out the corresponding advertisements. Hence, from the result of this project, the company can make their advertisements more targeted and effective. Hope you enjoy it!
